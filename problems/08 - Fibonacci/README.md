# Fibonacci

[Computerphile presents Fibonacci](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t_pTlH9HwA)

By definition, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.

The first ten Fibonacci numbers are:

```
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34
```

Write a class `Fibonacci` with a method `atIndex(n)` that accepts a number and returns the number at that position in the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci value at index n should be computed recursively.
